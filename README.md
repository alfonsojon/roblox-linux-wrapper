### As of March of 2020, this script does *not* work with the latest versions of Roblox Player

~~This is because the game uses VMProtect anti cheat, which Wine causes it to detect tampering. No ETA for a fix is available. The only way for this to be fixed is if Wine upstream is able to support VMProtect to a high enough degree, or if Roblox themselves release a Linux build.~~ The script itself will still install Roblox on Linux, but do not expect to be able to play online.

As of November, VMProtect is no longer the problem. The game launches and is playable for a few seconds before the client is kicked. Wine currently cannot solve the challenge packet sent by the server as an anticheat measure. The possibility of a fix still comes down to Wine's capability to handle this particular anticheat measure in the future, or the Roblox devs providing official support. 

There is a potential fix for this mentioned in [this issue](https://github.com/roblox-linux-wrapper/roblox-linux-wrapper/issues/187#issuecomment-859934169), which has been merged upstream. A future Wine update may resolve this issue.

## Reporting Issues
If you plan on reporting issues, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/roblox-linux-wrapper/roblox-linux-wrapper/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before doing so. Thanks!

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You should have Wine installed already. Install the appropriate version of `wine` from [this page](https://wiki.winehq.org/Download). I recommend wine-staging as it has the latest fixes and highest probability of working.

### source (via `git clone`)

To install Roblox on your Linux computer from Git source, run the following commands in a terminal:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/roblox-linux-wrapper/roblox-linux-wrapper.git
roblox-linux-wrapper/rlw
```

If you are saavy enough, you can also clone to a custom directory of your choice.

## Updates

Roblox Linux Wrapper is very volatile, and updates are released very often, so please check for updates frequently.

### from Git source
* Open a terminal, change to the directory you installed.
* Run `git pull` inside the terminal while in that directory.

## Diagnosing the game
Often times, a Roblox update breaks compatibility with the Roblox Linux Wrapper. Many of these changes will require an update to wine, which may come out months after the issue is introduced. In order to circumvent this issue, the wrapper now allows you to choose either wine or wine-staging, to allow you to use the release of wine that works best for you. It will ask you upon launching, and there is also an option labelled "Select Wine Release" in the launcher.
* If wine works fine, keep using wine.
* If wine-staging works, keep using it. Do note that wine-staging is pre-release software - you may encounter issues.

## Questions and Answers

* Q: How do I install this?
  * A: See the Installation section.

* Q: What do I do if the game is very slow?
  * A: Open Roblox Studio settings, change `graphicsMode` to `OpenGL`.

* Q: It tells me there is a syntax error, or I'm having another problem.
  * A: Download the script again and retry. If the same thing occurs, [open a new issue here](https://github.com/roblox-linux-wrapper/roblox-linux-wrapper/issues).

* Q: Roblox isn't behaving like it should.
  * A: Select the "Reinstall Roblox" option and press "Ok". If you continue having problems, [file a bug report here](https://github.com/roblox-linux-wrapper/roblox-linux-wrapper/issues).

* Q: What is the "Play Roblox (Legacy Mode)" option?
  * A: This is the old method used to launch games. Paste the game link in and click "Play" to launch the game.

* Q: It keeps telling me "Missing Dependencies"!
  * A: Then install it! If it tells you "Please install wine", then install Wine. It does not install these dependencies automatically. To install the latest version of Wine, visit https://www.winehq.org/download/.


## Required Dependencies

* git
* wget
